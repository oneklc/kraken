# Currency Pair

In a currency pair, the value of the base currency is displayed relative to the quote currency. The currency pair is 
priced in terms of the quote currency and the price indicates how much of the quote currency is required to buy one 
unit of the base currency. For example, a price of $110 for XBT/USD means that $110 USD is required to purchase 1 
XBT. In currency pair trading on Kraken, a pair can effectively be a single trading instrument that is opened as a 
position by buying (going long) or selling (going short) the pair.

# Maker Take
From the email: What is a maker taker model? In a maker taker model, reduced fees are given to the market “makers” 
who provide liquidity to the market “takers”. The maker fee applies when you add liquidity to the order book by 
placing a limit buy below market price or a limit sell above market price. The maker fee is paid only when such 
orders are taken by new incoming orders. The taker fee applies when you remove liquidity from the book by placing a 
market or limit order that executes immediately against a limit order already on the book. All advanced orders 
trigger either market or limit orders and the triggered market or limit order will be maker or taker as described 
above.
